Description
-----------
This project is an online tool developed using JavaScript and **Three.js** that allows users to design custom 3D printable vases. Users can interactively modify the vase's profile using control points, adjust dimensions, choose curve types, and set parameters like wall thickness and base shape. The final design can be previewed in real-time in a 3D environment and exported as an `.obj` file suitable for 3D printing.

This application was created primarily as a learning exercise to practice and showcase skills in 3D web development, procedural geometry generation, user interface design with vanilla JavaScript, and working with the Three.js library. It is non-commercial.

Features
--------
*   **Interactive Vase Design:** Modify the vase profile using draggable control points.
*   **Customizable Shape:** Choose between smooth (Spline) and sharp (Polyline) curves, with adjustable tension or fillet radius.
*   **Adjustable Parameters:** Control overall vase width, depth, wall thickness, base corner rounding (fillet), and drainage hole size.
*   **Real-time 3D Preview:** See your design update instantly in the interactive canvas powered by Three.js.
*   **OBJ Export:** Download your unique creation as a 3D printable `.obj` file, scaled in millimeters.

Usage and Purpose
-----------------
*   **Purpose:** To deepen understanding and proficiency in Three.js, 3D geometry manipulation, event handling, and building interactive web applications.
*   **Non-commercial:** This project is purely for educational, portfolio, and demonstration purposes. It is free to use and not intended for commercial profit.
*   **Assets:** The flowerpot logo used is custom-designed for this project. Core 3D functionality relies on Three.js
